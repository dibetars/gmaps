## 1. Objective

Build a location-aware web application where users can view a Google Map, draw geofences, view places within those geofences, and mark them as visited or not. The application automatically subdivides larger geofences into smaller hexagonal areas for better area management.

## 2. Scope

### Core Features

- Dashboard with visit statistics
- Interactive Google Map with geofence drawing tools
- Automatic geofence subdivision into hexagonal areas
